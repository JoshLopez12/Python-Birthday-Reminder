Birthday Reminder Program (Python)
Josh Lopez

Description: 
		When the program is run, the user is promted to enter a text file containing a list of names and their respective birthdays.
		The file entered must be an existing .txt file or the program will print an error message. The list must have at least 2 
		strings on each line, with one or more strings being the person's name and the last string being the date of their birthday in 
		MMDD format. The program will then scan through the list and print a message displaying all of the names that have birthdays 
		today (if any), along with the names and dates of the birthdays coming up in the next week. The user will recieve a warning 
		message if the last string on a line in the file is not a valid date. The user can also receive a warning message if a line
                in their file does not have at least one string for a name and one string for a date. Lines that invoke these warning messages
		will be ignored and the program will continue. Entering an empty text file causes the program to print a message and stop 
		running.
